# StudentHub
Studenthub is the website i create for my group members in web development group assignment whereby students can buy study materials. It runs in my locally server. I coded it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend and for the backend i used little bit of JavaScript and also PHP. I used XAMPP/MySQL for the databases.
